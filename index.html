        Introduction to the Web

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The basics include: the web, html, url's, http, and web applications. Web apps
          will be integral part of course. The WWW is a collection of HTML docs (basis
          for all webpages, HTML glues everything together). Major pieces include: You
          (browser), the Internet, and Servers. HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol is used
          as the communication medium).

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML stands for <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup Language</span>, and is made up of
          text content (what you see), markup (what it looks like), references to
          other docs, and links to other pages. Note: plain text is plain text
          in HTML. You want to utilize "markup" to make it look different. (CSS)
        </p>
        <span class="italic">HTML Markup</span>
        <p>
          Markups include tags (opening/closing), which encompasses an entire "element" that
          is used to make the text behave a certain way. Utlizing <a href="scratchpad.io">scratchpad.io</a>
          as a testing medium for code. Note: can "nest" tags. Note: can force multiple lines and
          paragraphs. Inline vs. Block.<br>

          What to take away from this lesson.The five most important things to take from this lesson are the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          1 - <span class="italic">What a Web Page Is</span>
          <br>
          A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret 
          and display them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 - <span class="italic">How Coding Works</span>
          <br>
          Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow 
          the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:&ltbr&gt
        </p>
        <p>
          3 - <span class="italic">Computers are Stupid</span>
          <br>
          Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
          For example, if you forget to close a &ltb&gt tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended 
          to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know 
          how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          4 - <span class="italic">Programmers Can't Remember Everything</span>
          <br>
          There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic 
          in HTML, you can always just look it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          5 - <span class="italic">Basic HTML Vocabulary</span>
          <br>
          You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (&ltp&gt for example) 
          and a closing tag, (&lt/p&gt). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the &ltbr&gt tag).
        </p>
        <p>
          * Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          * Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set thehref attribute of an anchor tag to the 
          Udacity URL, you would write &lta href="www.udacity.com"&gt.

    <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">
        HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          There are three elements to a webpage: <span class="bold">HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT</span>. HTML is like the structure of a house. 
          CSS is the style (i.e. color of walls, cabinetry, etc.).
          JAVASCRIPT is interactive, change an element (i.e. a chair, a lamp). Note: Developer Tools Tab in Google Chrome.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML and CSS are both languages (syntax+rules)(tag is word. HTML controls
          the structure of a web page. CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).
          When programmers talk about DOM (Document Object Model) they are talking
          about the tree-like structure of a page (DOM Tree).
        </p>
        <p>
          Key Term: <span class="italic">boxify</span>
        </p>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">
        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the “style” of a page, and is to prevent repeating. 
          Example: “Style” - .description{color:red;} - turns words red inside of “description” box. 
          Note: can do this in <a href="scratchpad.io">scratchpad.io</a> by using &ltstyle&gt &lt/style&gt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analogy: sheets are like laws. National Laws &lt State Laws &lt Municipality Laws &lt House Rules. 
          CSS says House Rules become National Law. “Most specific rule applied” is the definition of <span class="bold">Cascading</span>. 
          Font-style: normal, italic, oblique. (use CSS reference site to look up). Note: For “Code Comments,” HTML begins 
          with <!— and ends with —>. Everything in between is ignored. CSS begins with “/*" and ends with “*/".

        Why Abstraction?
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Inheritance</span> requires abstract thinking.  <span class="bold">Abstraction</span> is to avoid repetitive work.  
          Inheritance = faster-loading, less bandwidth.  Rules are interpreted in-between the 
          brackets, and are applied to the specified element (i.e. h1).  There is always a 
          property and a value (property:value = declaration).

        Box Sizing
      </div> 
      <div class="concept-description">
        <ol>
          <li>
            HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues. First, set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels. 
            Second, set the “box-sizing” attribute to “border-box” for every element.
          </li>

        Box Positioning
      </div> 
      <div class="concept-description">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding the rule “display: flex;” to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.
          </li>
